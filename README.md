# Sacrament Meeting Talk Assistant

A conversational AI assistant designed to help members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints prepare meaningful sacrament meeting talks through guided collaboration.

## What This Assistant Does

This is **not** a talk-writing robot. Instead, it's a collaborative partner that helps you:

- Develop your own ideas through thoughtful questions
- Organize your thoughts into a coherent structure
- Find relevant scriptures and stories
- Ensure appropriate length and flow
- Keep your authentic voice and testimony at the center

The talk remains **yours** - the assistant just helps you build it.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access Claude

Visit [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and sign in (or create a free account if you don't have one).

### Step 2: Start a New Conversation

Click to start a new chat with Claude.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevorallred/talk-agent/refs/heads/main/agent.txt

I'm ready to get started when you are.
```

Claude will fetch the instructions and begin helping you with your talk preparation.

## How It Works

### Initial Questions

The assistant will start by asking you:

1. **Topic**: Do you have an assigned topic or can you choose your own?
2. **Length**: How long should your talk be? (5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes)
3. **Speaking pace**: Do you speak slowly, moderately, or quickly?
4. **Current stage**: Where are you in the process?

These answers help customize the assistance to your specific needs.

### The Process

Depending on where you are, the assistant will guide you through:

**Brainstorming** (if you're just starting)
- Questions to draw out your ideas
- Help identifying personal experiences
- Suggestions for scriptures and stories
- Finding 2-4 main points

**Organizing** (if you have ideas but need structure)
- Creating an outline with Opening → Body → Closing
- Ensuring logical flow
- Balancing different elements

**Drafting** (if you're ready to write)
- Section-by-section development
- Maintaining your voice
- Including placeholders for personal stories
- Checking length and pacing

**Refining** (if you have a draft)
- Improving transitions
- Adjusting length
- Polishing language
- Optional translation

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Conversational

Talk naturally with the assistant. Share your thoughts, experiences, and concerns as they come up.

### Share Your Ideas First

The assistant works best when building on *your* thoughts. Don't expect it to generate ideas from scratch - it's there to draw out and organize what you already have.

### Iterate Freely

It's okay to change direction, try different structures, or revise sections multiple times. That's part of the process.

### Use the Artifacts Feature

Claude will likely create your talk outline or draft in an "Artifact" - a formatted document you can easily copy, edit, and save. You can ask it to update specific sections without rewriting everything.

### Be Specific About Your Voice

If a draft doesn't sound like you, say so! Ask the assistant to adjust the tone, simplify language, or make it more formal/casual.

## Example Conversation Starter

After loading the instructions, you might say:

> "I've been asked to speak on faith for 10 minutes. I speak at a moderate pace. I'm just starting to brainstorm and feeling a bit stuck on where to begin."

The assistant will then guide you through questions to develop your talk.

## Translation Support

If your ward needs the talk translated for records or members who speak other languages, mention this at the end. The assistant can help translate the final version.

## Privacy Note

Your conversation with Claude is private. However, don't share sensitive personal information you wouldn't want in a written record.

## Feedback & Improvements

This is an open-source project. If you have suggestions for improving the agent instructions, please contribute to the repository or share your feedback.

## About
